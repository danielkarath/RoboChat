A ChatGPT powered AI chatbot iOS app optimized for iPhone. 

# About
I built this chat app around the time ChatGPT became popular. I built this project fully with UIKit and my goal was to make it as accessible as I can. I considered the job done once I can use it confortable with my eyes closed. 

# Features
I tried to focus a lot on accessibility here thus the app utilizes AVFoundation and Speech to enable the user to use their speech to initiate requests to ChatGPT. The app uses the OpenAI ChatGPT API, and heavily relies on Adam Rush's OpenAI Swift wrapper library, which you can check out here: [**OpenAISwift**](https://github.com/danielkarath/RoboChat) (https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift).

# What I learned?
This project helped a lot to make me familiar with the AVFoundation and how speech to text works and how to make apps in general more accessible. It was also a good practice on networking.
